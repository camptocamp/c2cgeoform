# c2cgeoform

`c2cgeoform` is a framework easing the creation of web pages with forms. Users
of `c2cgeoform` declaratively create *models*, from which the framework
can create forms, views, lists, â€¦

`c2cgeoform` supports various data types, including *geometry* types (points,
lines, polygons). For geometry types `c2geoform` generates maps with editing
tools to create, modify or delete geometries.

`c2cgeoform` is based on [Pylons technologies](http://www.pylonsproject.org/).
More specifically, it uses
[Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html),
[Colander](http://colander.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), and
[Deform](http://deform.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). For interacting with the
database it uses [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and
[GeoAlchemy 2](https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
